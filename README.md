Tetris
======

Why?
----

Why does the world need another Tetris?
Because it is just about time that I have my own Tetris :-).

OK, on a more serious note I've played around with Clojure in my free time for 1+ years now and I find the language very exciting, but haven't done any serious projects in it.
Recently, I've been looking at [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async) and read most of David Nolen's blog posts on the subject at http://swannodette.github.io/.
I liked the ideas on building UIs in David's blog so I've decided to try it out. I needed a project that is preferably less trivial than a TODO application. 

I thought Tetris might be a good match.
